# MusicQEARY

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.2.

## About

MusicQEARY lets you see a visual representation of the musical attributes of your Spotify Playlists and Songs. We use Spotify's API to get a variety of data about the music you listen to and create playlist averages and user averages for your audio data. 

## MusicQEARY API

The MusicQEARY API can be found at our [Github](https://github.com/drewawright/GoodQuestion).  

## Check it out

MusicQEARY's angular application is currently hosted [here](https://tc-musicqeary.herokuapp.com/). A locally running API is currently required for MusicQEARY.
